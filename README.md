   - Tempo and time signature markings
   - Dynamic markings (pp, p, mp, mf, f, ff)
   - Rest notation between notes

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone the Enhanced Fork (Recommended)

1. Clone this enhanced repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skarath13/midi.git
cd midi
```

### Option 2: Upgrade from Original Repository

If you have the original repository, you can add this fork as a remote:
```bash
# Add the enhanced fork as a remote
git remote add enhanced https://github.com/Skarath13/midi.git

# Fetch and merge the improvements
git fetch enhanced
git merge enhanced/main
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Set MuseScore path for sheet music rendering:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
export MUSESCORE_PATH=/usr/bin/mscore

# Windows PowerShell
setx MUSESCORE_PATH "C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin\mscore.exe"
```

## Usage

### Web Application

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8001`

3. Choose your transcription method:
   - **üéµ Advanced**: Best for sheet music with proper rhythm and rests
   - **üåä Smooth**: Best for MIDI playback without artifacts
   - **‚ú® Improved**: Good general-purpose transcription
   - **ü•Å Onset-based**: Best for rhythmic/percussive music
   - **üéØ Filtered**: Cleanest output with filtered notes

4. Upload an audio file (WAV, MP3, or FLAC)

5. Click "Transcribe the Magic ‚ú®"

6. Download:
   - **MIDI file**: For use in any DAW or music software
   - **MusicXML**: For notation software like MuseScore, Finale, or Sibelius
   - **PNG preview**: Visual sheet music (if MuseScore is installed)

### Command Line

For direct processing without the web interface:
```bash
python main.py
```
This expects an `input.wav` file in the project directory and generates:
- `transcription_output.mid`
- `output_sheet.musicxml`
- `output_sheet.png` (if MuseScore is configured)

- **Window function**: Hann window for cleaner frequency analysis
- **Magnitude threshold**: 0.1 (adaptive based on RMS energy)
- **Pitch smoothing**: 5-point median filter
- **Confidence weighting**: Weighted median for pitch selection

**Rhythm Analysis:**
- **Beat tracking**: Ellis dynamic programming algorithm
- **Onset detection**: Spectral flux with median aggregation
- **Quantization grid**: 16th note resolution (adjustable)
- **Tempo range**: 50-200 BPM automatic detection
- **Time signatures**: 3/4, 4/4, 6/8 (automatic detection)

**MIDI Generation:**
- **Velocity range**: 60-100 (dynamically adjusted)
- **Note overlap prevention**: Automatic trimming
- **Minimum note duration**: 50ms

## Examples

### Transcription Results

The Advanced mode excels at:
- **Classical Music**: Proper tempo and measure organization
- **Pop/Rock**: Accurate rhythm with rest detection
- **Solo Instruments**: Clean note separation
- **Vocals**: Smooth pitch tracking with proper phrasing

### Console Output
```
[INFO] Detected tempo: 120.0 BPM
[INFO] Advanced MIDI written to static/output.mid
[INFO] Tempo: 120.0 BPM
[INFO] Time Signature: 4/4
[INFO] Total notes: 42
[INFO] Average note interval: 0.251s
[INFO] Most common interval: 0.250s
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No tempo detected**: Try the "Improved" mode for non-rhythmic audio
2. **Wrong time signature**: The system defaults to 4/4 for ambiguous cases
3. **Missing notes**: Lower the magnitude threshold in the code
4. **Too many notes**: Increase the minimum note duration
