# Music Transcription Improvements with Ghibli UI

## Summary

This pull request introduces significant improvements to the music transcription application:

1. **Fixed MIDI Playback Issues** - Resolved the "glitchy" sound problem where MIDI files were skipping
2. **Beautiful Ghibli-Inspired UI** - Complete frontend redesign with animated elements and Tailwind CSS
3. **Enhanced Transcription Methods** - Three different algorithms for better accuracy

## What Changed

### Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed overlapping MIDI notes issue by consolidating consecutive frames of same pitch
- ✅ Implemented proper note duration calculation instead of fixed 0.4s lengths
- ✅ Added onset detection for better note segmentation
- ✅ Fixed PNG sheet music generation and display

### New Features
- 🎨 Beautiful Ghibli-inspired animated UI with floating clouds and musical notes
- 🎵 Three transcription methods: Improved (default), Onset-based, and Filtered
- 📊 Real-time statistics showing number of detected notes
- 🎹 Clean, intuitive interface with method selection

### Code Improvements
- 📁 Removed deprecated files and cleaned up codebase
- 📝 Added comprehensive documentation (README.md and IMPROVEMENTS.md)
- 🔧 Improved error handling and user feedback

## Technical Details

The main issue was in the original pitch detection logic that created a new MIDI note for every analysis frame (~23ms), resulting in hundreds of overlapping notes. The improved version:

1. Groups consecutive frames with the same pitch into single notes
2. Calculates actual note durations
3. Filters out artifacts and noise
4. Provides multiple transcription methods for different audio types

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Upload an audio file (WAV, MP3, or FLAC)
3. Select a transcription method
4. Compare the MIDI output - it should play smoothly without glitches

## Screenshots

The new Ghibli-inspired interface features:
- Animated clouds and musical notes
- Gradient backgrounds inspired by Studio Ghibli films
- Clean, card-based layout for results
- Beautiful hover effects and transitions

## Files Changed

- Modified: `app.py` - Updated to use improved transcription methods
- Added: `pitch_detect_improved.py` - New pitch detection algorithms
- Added: `midi_writer_improved.py` - Improved MIDI generation
- Modified: `templates/index.html` - Complete UI redesign
- Added: `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- Added: `IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Technical details of improvements
- Removed: Various deprecated files (old pitch_detect.py, midi_writer.py, etc.)

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure `MUSESCORE_PATH` environment variable is set if PNG generation is needed
- The application uses the `static/` directory for uploaded files
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`
